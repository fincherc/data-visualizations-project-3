# Data Visualizations - Project 3

By: Christian Fincher, Jamey Yadon, Steve Yuan, and Sarah Dutton

## Overview and Purpose of the Project:

This project is focusing on the Austin-Metro area. We analyzed and visualized trends of highly accident-prone areas, times, and weather conditions. 

The dataset started as a countrywide car accident dataset that covers 49 states of the USA. The accident data was collected from February 2016 - March 2023, using multiple APIs that provide streaming traffic incident data. These APIs broadcast traffic data captures by various entities including the US and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic sensors within the road networks. The dataset origionated with approximately 7.7 million accident records.
